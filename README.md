Here you can find the Web Api for the project **ClinicGAP**. This is consumed by the Angular project **_WebClinicGAP_**, equally available on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/Jefffer/WebClinicGAP

## Launch the application

To launch all the application correctly, you must clone both repositories and run them simultaneously on the appropriate port, please validate them iin the corresponding files:

### For Angular project

Check the line `readonly rootURL = "http://localhost:60009/api"; // API connection` defined in the _components.service.ts_ of `patient`, `user` and `appointment`
